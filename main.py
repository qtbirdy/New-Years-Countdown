# Instead of adding end="", build a list first that contains the content of the row you want to print
# then convert the list into a string, by combining (joining elements) of that list with an empty string

   # print(my_row_items_as_a_string)
    
# (more advanced) Do all of the above + use a list comprehension when you can for speedups in computation
